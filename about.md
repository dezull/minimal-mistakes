I am web & Android application developer living in Malaysia. For a change, I am currently working with a local company that specializes in Computer Security, though I still write code on a daily basis. I speak English and Malay.

I have worked with various programming languages & development frameworks, but consider myself to be fluent in Java (Android Framework), PHP (Symfony2 and Silex) and Javascript.

## My Works

Here are some of my notable works (publicly available works, [contact me](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}) to see my other works).

### Web Application

* [mycite.my](http://mycite.my ) - Malaysian Citation Index, like [Scopus](http://www.scopus.com), but for Malaysian journals. Built on [Symfony2](http://symfony.com) with superfast [Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com/) indexer, migrated from the unmaintainable mess of plain PHP.

### Android

* [FancyLiveWall](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bulb_vision.wallpaper.fancylivewall&hl=en) - A live wallpaper, showing user photos with customizable effects & themes. It was my first attempt on Android development, full of bugs and currently not being maintained. But still, more that 50, 000 users have installed it.

* [Direktori Halal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blogspot.aptgetmoo.dhj&hl=en) - A directory for Halal products & premises, for Malaysian users. The data is fetched from [JAKIM's web directory](http://www.halal.gov.my/v3/index.php/ms/direktori-halal-malaysia/126-direktori-halal-malaysia). The app is very stable, not a single bug report for the last 6 months!.

### Browser Extensions

* dontphishme - A browser extension for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dontphishme/ekhmajimailppllbglbkopdjfenocpnl?hl=en) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.antiphishing.my/download-addon.php?b=firefox). Internet Explorer's version is coming real soon!. It provides detection for phishing sites faking Malaysian Banking sites. Unlike [Google Safe Browsing API](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/) which relies on a pre-compiled list of URLs, its proactive approach allows newly encountered phishing sites to be detected as well. Kudos to its creator, [@xanda](https://twitter.com/xanda)!.
